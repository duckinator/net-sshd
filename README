Ruby Net::SSHD aims to be a generic SSH protocol server to be used as a
listener providing a transport layer for SSH connections.

The intent is to use it as a secure replacement for insecure plain text
TCP socket listeners to serve any arbitary "telnet" protocol encapsulated
in the ssh transport, preferrably supporting only public key authentication.

At this stage, it's just a crude hack worth a few hours of code and barely
handles the first stages of the handshake, so feel free to fork and contribute
patches.

It would be nice to reuse as much of Net::SSH as possible.

The end goal would be to provide a full SSH implementation in Ruby, similar to
the Erlang SSH library, which also provides a daemon in addition to just the
client libraries.
